## The Key Insight

ShepLang exists because we believe:

> **AI should be a language primitive, not an integration.**

Instead of:
```python
# Traditional approach
import openai
response = openai.chat(prompt="classify sentiment")
```

ShepLang gives you:
```shep
# ShepLang approach
sentiment: ai("classify as positive, neutral, negative")
```

The AI primitive is part of the language itself. It compiles to real code with retry logic, caching, and cost tracking built in.

## Get Started in 60 Seconds

```bash
# Install
npm install -g @goldensheepai/shep-cli

# Create a new project
shep new my-app
cd my-app

# Or let AI write your program
shep draft "A todo app with due dates and priorities"

# Compile to Python + TypeScript + SQL
shep compile --input app.shep --output generated
```

## Community Guidelines

1. **Be kind** — We're all learning
2. **Be specific** — Code examples help everyone
3. **Be patient** — This is a new language, rough edges exist
4. **Be constructive** — Criticism is welcome, hostility is not

## Questions?

Don't hesitate to ask! There are no stupid questions about a new programming language.
