# ShepLang Launch Strategy

## The Vision

**ShepLang is the first programming language with AI as a built-in verb.**

```
Human intent (natural language)
    ↓
AI generates ShepLang program
    ↓
Human reviews/edits ShepLang
    ↓
Compiler generates Python + JS + SQL
    ↓
Deploy to production
```

## Where to Publish & Why

### 1. npm (Primary Distribution) ✅ Ready

**Why npm?**
- ShepLang compiler is TypeScript, npm is the native distribution
- Developers can install with `npm install -g @goldensheepai/shep-cli`
- Integrates with existing JS/TS toolchains

**Packages:**
```
@goldensheepai/shep-cli      # The CLI (shep compile, shep draft, etc.)
@goldensheepai/shep-core     # Parser, verifier, types
@goldensheepai/shep-lsp      # Language Server Protocol
@goldensheepai/shep-sheplang # TypeScript code generation
@goldensheepai/shep-shepthon # Python code generation
```

**Publish Command:**
```bash
pnpm publish -r --access public
```

### 2. VS Code Marketplace 🔜 Next Step

**Why VS Code?**
- 75% of developers use VS Code
- Syntax highlighting + LSP = instant productivity
- Zero friction adoption

**Extension Ready:** `editors/vscode-extension/`

**Publish Steps:**
1. Create Azure DevOps account
2. Get Personal Access Token
3. `npx vsce publish`

### 3. GitHub (Source of Truth) ✅ Ready

**Why GitHub?**
- Open source builds trust
- Issues/Discussions for community
- Actions for CI/CD
- Releases for versioned downloads

**URL:** https://github.com/Radix-Obsidian/ShepStack

### 4. Documentation Site 🔜 Future

**Options:**
- GitHub Pages (free, easy)
- Docusaurus (React-based, good for languages)
- GitBook (beautiful, easy)

## Key Messages

### For Developers

> "ShepLang is TypeScript for AI-generated code. AI writes it, you review it, it compiles to real Python and JavaScript."

### For Founders

> "Describe your product in ShepLang, get a working app. AI handles the writing, you handle the vision."

### For AI Builders

> "ShepLang is the intermediate representation for AI-generated software. High-level enough for LLMs to reason about, precise enough to compile."
