# ShepLang Logo Design Brief

## Core Concept
ShepLang is the first programming language with AI as a built-in verb. The logo should represent the fusion of traditional programming and artificial intelligence.

## Logo Requirements

### Primary Logo (for VS Code Marketplace, npm, GitHub)
- **Format**: SVG (scalable) and PNG (128x128, 256x256, 512x512)
- **Style**: Modern, minimalist, tech-forward
- **Colors**: Dark theme friendly (works on both light/dark backgrounds)

### Visual Elements to Consider

#### 1. The Sheep (Shep)
- Minimalist sheep silhouette or abstract representation
- Could be geometric, not cartoonish
- Sheep represents "shepherding" AI-generated code

#### 2. AI Integration
- Circuit patterns, neural nodes, or AI brain elements
- Could be integrated into the sheep design
- Or as a separate element merged with programming symbols

#### 3. Programming Elements
- Code brackets `</>` or `{}` 
- Terminal/console elements
- Abstract code flow visualization

#### 4. Color Palette
- **Primary**: Deep purple (#6B46C1) or indigo (#4F46E5) - represents AI/tech
- **Secondary**: Emerald green (#10B981) or teal (#14B8A6) - represents growth/code
- **Accent**: Bright cyan (#06B6D4) or electric blue (#3B82F6) - represents intelligence
- **Neutral**: Dark grays for text compatibility

## Logo Variations Needed

### 1. Icon Only (128x128)
- Simple, recognizable at small size
- Works as VS Code extension icon
- No text, just the symbol

### 2. Horizontal Logo
- Icon + "ShepLang" text
- For website headers, documentation
- Text should be clean, modern sans-serif

### 3. Monogram Version
- "SL" or abstract sheep symbol
- For favicon, small spaces

### 4. Dark/Light Variants
- Optimized for both themes
- Maintain contrast and readability

## Design Direction Options

### Option A: The Code Sheep
- Geometric sheep made of code brackets and circuit patterns
- Clean lines, tech aesthetic
- Subtle AI elements integrated

### Option B: The Shepherd
- Abstract shepherd's crook combined with code symbols
- Represents guiding AI-generated code
- Minimalist and elegant

### Option C: The Fusion
- Split design: half traditional code, half AI neural patterns
- Represents the core concept of AI as language primitive
- Modern, balanced composition

### Option D: The Primitive
- Focus on the `ai()` concept
- Brackets containing an AI symbol
- Direct representation of the language's key feature

## Technical Specifications

### VS Code Extension Icon
- 128x128px minimum
- High contrast for visibility
- No text, just icon
- Works on both VS Code dark/light themes

### npm Package Logo
- Square format
- Professional, trustworthy appearance
- Scalable for different sizes

### GitHub Repository Avatar
- 280x280px
- Recognizable at small size
- Memorable and unique

## Brand Personality
- **Innovative**: Forward-thinking, cutting-edge
- **Approachable**: Not intimidating, developer-friendly
- **Professional**: Serious tool, not a toy
- **Intelligent**: Smart, sophisticated design

## What to Avoid
- Cartoonish or playful sheep (too cutesy)
- Overly complex designs (won't scale well)
- Generic tech logos (no differentiation)
- Too many colors or gradients (hard to reproduce)

## Inspiration References
- GitHub Octocat (minimalist, memorable)
- Rust logo (simple, strong)
- TypeScript logo (clean, professional)
- OpenAI logo (modern, AI-focused)

## Final Deliverables Requested

1. **Primary Icon** - SVG + PNG (128, 256, 512px)
2. **Horizontal Logo** - SVG + PNG
3. **Monogram** - SVG + PNG
4. **Dark/Light variants** of each
5. **Favicon** - 32x32px, 16x16px versions

The logo should instantly communicate: "This is about AI and programming working together seamlessly."
